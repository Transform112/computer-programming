# Story: You are working with a team of archaeologists and have found an ancient inscription with a special word. The word is a sequence of letters, but it is encrypted. You need to reverse the order of the letters in the word to reveal the message.

# Problem: Write a program that reads a word and prints the word in reverse order.

st = input("Enter a word :")
st2 = st[::-1]
print(st2)
